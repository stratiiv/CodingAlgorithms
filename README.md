## Coding Algorithms (qualification work for bachelor's degree in Chernivtsi National University)
In the qualification work the implementation of the educational web application "Coding Algorithms" using HTML, CSS(Bootstrap), JavaScript and Python(Django) was developed.

The application allows the user using the Heming algorithm to convert the specified symbol into noise-tolerant code to transmit it to the communication channel and decode the received encoded symbol, while checking for error and then correct; find the optimal binary code for the input alphabet using the Huffman and Shannon-Fano algorithms. The appendix also contains a theoretical part for acquaintance with the algorithms of information coding and a separate manual for the training course "Information Theory and Coding".
